Terminal 1 might be able to provide a visa.


Description


Most recruiters hate the internal tools they have to use. We know, because we work as contingency recruiters! We’re a group of technologists who thought recruitment was so important that we decided to become headhunters to thoroughly learn the space.


If we (technologists) work together with you (recruitment expert), we believe we can build tools that recruiters love to use. Every quarter, we target the area in recruitment that is most painful and manual and help automate it. Through this way of working, we hope to reach ever higher levels of automation and build truly valuable tools for recruiters.


About us:
We have been working on Terminal 1 for a year and grown to 5 full-time product designers, data scientists, and software engineers. Engineering from SV / companies like LinkedIn and Yandex.
We all work on both product and contingent recruitment for clients. We are generally profitable/break-even every quarter.
We have a rich client base that grows rapidly (~1-2 new clients per month like clockwork.) Some of them work exclusively with us.
We believe it’s time to hire our first pure recruiter to help bring our recruitment to the next level and free some of us to work more on product development.


About you:
Frustrated by current state of tools for external recruiters. Keen interest in technology, constant source of smart (and practical) ideas on tools that can help you place faster and at higher quality.
Proven ability in contingent recruitment, having billings exceeding HK$ 1.6m in any 12 month period. While you're comfortable operating a 360° desk, we usually need more help with candidate flow than clients.
Lots of intellectual horsepower and happy to fill a variety of roles in an early stage startup. Your duties might range from placing candidates to writing product spec to creating an attractive commission scheme for junior recruiters.
Imagine: instead of being frustrated at the state of tooling in your company, what if there was a group of talented technologists at your beck and call, working to help you succeed?


If you’re looking to be the most important person in your next company, please create a profile and contact us as soon as possible!

Overview:
In short, they are building a brand new trade advisory platform for private banking clients. The core concept is based on a data lake, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and a brand new Full Stack tech platform to support it and tie it all together.
The idea is that they want to use technology to simplify the way trade suggestions and advice is collated and presented to clients. This new system will create documents (emails, web sites, smartphone apps, etc) that will bundle together all of the necessary data, risk, research and information to present to clients. It will do this in record breaking time, removing the arduous and time costly process of gathering this information and analyzing it in person, meaning my client can be fastest to market. It will work within the client’s risk parameters and be able to access and include all relevant research and analysis at the click of a button.
A little further down the line, this system will begin to start making investment proposals by itself, by using Machine Learning and AI. Any trade or decision ever made by that client, or any similar client, before will have been stored in the data lake. The system will work with that data and real-time incoming data to predict and suggest the most suitable and interesting trade ideas to clients in real-time.

The roles:
Full Stack Developers
They are looking for passionate full stack software engineers to join a lean, agile, fast moving tech-loving team. As an experienced web dev you will be working closely with business users to build out a next generation trade advisory platform to be used by over 1k users across the investment and private bank. You will be a key contributor to architecting and delivering the product to our users.
